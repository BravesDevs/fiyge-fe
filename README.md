# 🛠️ Drag-and-Drop Form Builder with React & Vite

A customizable, drag-and-drop form builder built with **React**, **Vite**, **react-beautiful-dnd**, and **react-dnd**. This tool allows users to drag predefined form elements like text inputs, text areas, select dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers, and file uploads onto a canvas area. Each component comes with configurable properties (label, placeholder, required status, and validation) that can be customized within the builder.
